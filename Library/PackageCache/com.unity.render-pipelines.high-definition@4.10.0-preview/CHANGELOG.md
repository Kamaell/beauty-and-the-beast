- Fix ConvertPhysicalLightIntensityToLightIntensity() function used when creating light from script to match HDLightEditor behavior
- Fix numerical issues with the default value of mean free path of volumetric fog
- Fix the bug preventing decals from coexisting with density volumes
- Fix issue with alpha tested geometry using planar/triplanar mapping not render correctly or flickering (due to being wrongly alpha tested in depth prepass)
- Fix meta pass with triplanar (was not handling correctly the normal)
- Fix preview when a planar reflection is present
- Fix Camera preview, it is now a Preview cameraType (was a SceneView)
- Fix handling unknown GPUShadowTypes in the shadow manager.
- Fix area light shapes sent as point lights to the baking backends when they are set to baked.
- Fix unnecessary division by PI for baked area lights.
- Fix line lights sent to the lightmappers. The backends don't support this light type.
- Fix issue with shadow mask framesettings not correctly taken into account when shadow mask is enabled for lighting.
- Fix directional light and shadow mask transition, they are now matching making smooth transition
- Fix banding issues caused by high intensity volumetric lighting
- Fix the debug window being emptied on SRP asset reload
- Fix issue with debug mode not correctly clearing the GBuffer in editor after a resize
- Fix issue with ResetMaterialKeyword not resetting correctly ToggleOff/Roggle Keyword
- Fix issue with motion vector not render correctly if there is no depth prepass in deferred

## [2018.1.0f2]

### Added
- Screen Space Refraction projection model (Proxy raycasting, HiZ raymarching)
- Screen Space Refraction settings as volume component
- Added buffered frame history per camera
- Port Global Density Volumes to the Interpolation Volume System.
- Optimize ImportanceSampleLambert() to not require the tangent frame.
- Generalize SampleVBuffer() to handle different sampling and reconstruction methods.
- Improve the quality of volumetric lighting reprojection.
- Optimize Morton Order code in the Subsurface Scattering pass.
- Planar Reflection Probe support roughness (gaussian convolution of captured probe)
- Use an atlas instead of a texture array for cluster transparent decals
- Add a debug view to visualize the decal atlas
- Only store decal textures to atlas if decal is visible, debounce out of memory decal atlas warning.
- Add manipulator gizmo on decal to improve authoring workflow
- Add a minimal StackLit material (work in progress, this version can be used as template to add new material)

### Changed
- EnableShadowMask in FrameSettings (But shadowMaskSupport still disable by default)
- Forced Planar Probe update modes to (Realtime, Every Update, Mirror Camera)
- Screen Space Refraction proxy model uses the proxy of the first environment light (Reflection probe/Planar probe) or the sky
- Moved RTHandle static methods to RTHandles
- Renamed RTHandle to RTHandleSystem.RTHandle
- Move code for PreIntegratedFDG (Lit.shader) into its dedicated folder to be share with other material
- Move code for LTCArea (Lit.shader) into its dedicated folder to be share with other material

### Removed
- Removed Planar Probe mirror plane position and normal fields in inspector, always display mirror plane and normal gizmos

### Fixed
- Fix fog flags in scene view is now taken into account
- Fix sky in preview windows that were disappearing after a load of a new level
- Fix numerical issues in IntersectRayAABB().
- Fix alpha blending of volumetric lighting with transparent objects.
- Fix the near plane of the V-Buffer causing out-of-bounds look-ups in the clustered data structure.
- Depth and color pyramid are properly computed and sampled when the camera renders inside a viewport of a RTHandle.
- Fix decal atlas debug view to work correctly when shadow atlas view is also enabled
