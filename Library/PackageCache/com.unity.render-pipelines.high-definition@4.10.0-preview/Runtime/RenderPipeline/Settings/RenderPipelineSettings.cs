    // A Camera with HDAdditionalData has one FrameSettings that configures how it will render. For example a camera used for reflection will disable distortion and post-process.
    // Additionally, on a Camera there is another FrameSettings called ActiveFrameSettings that is created on the fly based on FrameSettings and allows modifications for debugging purpose at runtime without being serialized on disk.
    // The ActiveFrameSettings is registered in the debug windows at the creation of the camera.
    // A Camera with HDAdditionalData has a RenderPath that defines if it uses a "Default" FrameSettings, a preset of FrameSettings or a custom one.
    // HDRenderPipelineAsset contains a "Default" FrameSettings that can be referenced by any camera with RenderPath.Defaut or when the camera doesn't have HDAdditionalData like the camera of the Editor.
    // It also contains a DefaultActiveFrameSettings

    // RenderPipelineSettings represents settings that are immutable at runtime.
    // There is a dedicated RenderPipelineSettings for each platform
