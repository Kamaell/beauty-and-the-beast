# Material Type

The Material Type property allows you to give your Material a type, which allows you to customize it with different settings depending on the Material Type you select. Each Material Type has a different workflow and so use the Material Type that is most suitable for the Shader you are creating.

| Property                        | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Subsurface scattering (SSS)** | SSS simulates the way light interacts with and penetrates translucent objects, such as skin or plants. When light penetrates the surface of a SSS Material it scatters and blurs before exiting the surface at a different point.This option exposes the **Enable Transmission** property as a child |
| **- Enable Transmission**       | This parameter simulates the translucency of an object and it is managed by a thickness map.  SSS and transmission settings are configured using a [Diffusion Profile](Diffusion-Profile.html), which is explained below. See documentation on [Subsurface Scattering](Subsurface-Scattering.html) for more information. |
| **Standard**                    | Uses the basic parameters and is the default Material type. Standard uses a basic metallic Shader workflow. This option exposes the **Metallic** slider in the **Inputs** section of the Material. See the Inputs section of the [Lit Shader Documentation](Lit-Shader.html) for information on this settings. |
| **Anisotropy**                  | The highlights of Anisotropic surfaces change in appearance as you view the Material from different angles. Use the Anisotropy Material Type to create Materials that require anisotropic highlights, for example: brushed metal or velvet. |
| **Iridescence**                 | Iridescent surfaces appear to gradually change colour as the angle of view or angle of illumination changes. Use the Iridescence Material Type to create materials like soap bubbles, iridescent metal, or insect wings. |
| **Specular Color**              | Use The Specular Colour Material Type to create Materials with a coloured specular highlight. This Material Type is similar to the [built-in Specular Shader](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameterSpecular.html). You can disable energy conservation by unticking the **Energy Conserving Specular** checkbox. |
| **Translucent**                 | Use The Translucent Material Type to simulate a translucent material using a thickness map. In contrast to SSS Materials, Translucent Materials only transmit light through the Material, without blurring the light. |
