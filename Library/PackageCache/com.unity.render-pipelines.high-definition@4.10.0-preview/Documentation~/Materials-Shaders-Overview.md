# Materials and Shaders

The High Definition Render Pipeline introduces multiple Shaders that contain new properties to help you fulfill all of your rendering needs to a high standard. They are purpose built to cover everything from standard lit and unlit Materials all the way to terrain, decals, and advanced layered Materials.

When you create a new Material, it uses the [Lit Shader](Lit-Shader.html) by default. 

To change the Shader for a Material:

1. In the Unity Editor, select the Material.
2.  In the Inspector, click the Shader drop-down menu at the top of the Material.
3. Select **HDRenderPipeline**, then choose your desired HDRP Shader from the list.
