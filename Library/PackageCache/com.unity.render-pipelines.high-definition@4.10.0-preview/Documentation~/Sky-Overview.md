# Sky overview

HDRP provides different methods of producing sky within your Unity Project. You can choose which sky type to use for each [Volume](Volumes.html) in your Scene by altering the Sky Type property in the Volume’s [Visual Environment](Visual-Environment.html) override. HDRP provides the following types of sky:

   - [Procedural Sky](Procedural-Sky.html): Produces an environment based on the values you choose within the Procedural Sky Volume component. This is similar to Unity’s built-in render pipeline procedural sky.
   - [Gradient Sky](Gradient-Sky.html): Renders a simple sky with three color zones for the top, middle, and bottom sections of the sky.
   - [HDRI Sky](HDRI-Sky.html): Constructs a sky environment based on a cubemap texture you set within the HDRI Volume component.
