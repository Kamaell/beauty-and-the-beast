# Physical Light units

HDRP uses Physical Light Units (PLU) for its lighting. These units are based on real-life light measurements, like those you see on light bulb packaging or a photographic light meter.

### Candelas

The base unit of luminous intensity in the International System of Units. For reference, a common wax candle emits light with a luminous intensity of roughly 1 candela.

### Lumens

The unit of luminous flux. Measures the total quantity of visible light a source emits. A light source emitting 1 candela of luminous intensity from an area of 1 steradian has a luminous flux of 1 lumen.

### Luminance

Measures the apparent brightness of light either emitted from a light source, or reflected off a surface, to the human eye. A light source that emits 1 candela of luminous intensity onto an area of 1 square meter has a luminance of 1 candela per square meter.

### Lux

The unit of illuminance. A light source that emits 1 lumen of luminous flux onto an area of 1 square meter has an illuminance of 1 lux.

### Exposure value (EV)

A value that represents a combination of a camera's shutter speed and f-number. It is essentially a measurement of exposure such that all combinations of shutter speed and f-number that yield the same level of exposure have the same EV. HDRP Lights can use Ev 100, which is Ev with a 100 International Standards Organisation (ISO) film.

## Natural light levels

Light measurements from natural sources in different conditions:

| Illuminance (lux) | Natural light level                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 120 000           | Very bright sunlight.                             |
| 110 000           | Bright sunlight.                                  |
| 20 000            | Blue sky at midday.                               |
| 1 000 - 2 000     | Overcast sky at midday.                           |
| < 1               | Moonlight with a clear night sky.                 |
| 0.002             | Starry night without moonlight. Includes airglow. |

## Artificial light intensities

Approximate light measurements from artificial sources:

| Luminous flux (lumen) | Source                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 12.57                 | Candle light.                                                |
| < 100                 | Small decorative light, such as a small LED lamp.            |
| 200 - 300             | Decorative lamp, such as a lamp that does not provide the main lighting for a bright room. |
| 400 - 800             | Ceiling lamp for a regular room.                             |
| 800 - 1 200           | Ceiling lamp for a large brightly lit room.                  |
| 1 000 - 40 000        | Bright street light.                                         |

## Indoor light levels

Architects use these approximate values as a guide when designing rooms and buildings for functional use:

| Illuminance (lux) | Room type                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| 150 - 300         | Bedroom.                   |
| 300 - 500         | Classroom.                 |
| 300 - 750         | Kitchen.                   |
| 300 - 500         | Kitchen Counter or Office. |
| 100 - 300         | Bathroom.                  |
| 750 lux - 1 000   | Supermarket.               |
| 30                | City street at night.      |
