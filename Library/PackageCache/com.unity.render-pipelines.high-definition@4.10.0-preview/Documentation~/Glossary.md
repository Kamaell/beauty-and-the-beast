# High Definition Render Pipeline Glossary

## General terms

<a name="AtmosphericScattering"></a>

#### atmospheric scattering
Atmospheric scattering is the phenomena that occurs when particles suspended in the atmosphere diffuse (or scatter) a portion of the light, passing through them, in all directions.


<a name="NyquistRate"></a>

#### Nyquist rate:
The minimum rate at which you can sample a real-world signal without introducing errors. This is equal to double the highest frequency of the real-world signal.

<a name="RayMarching"></a>

#### ray marching:
An iterative ray intersection test where your ray marches back and forth until it finds the intersection or, in a more general case, solves the problem you define for it.

<a name="TextureAtlas"></a>

#### texture atlas:

A texture atlas is a large texture containing several smaller textures packed together. HDRP uses texture atlases for shadow maps and decals.



### Aliasing and anti-aliasing terms

<a name="Aliasing"></a>

#### aliasing:
Describes a distortion between a real-world signal and a digital reconstruction of a sample of a signal and the original signal itself.

<a name="FastApproximateAntiAliasing"></a>

#### fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA):
An anti-aliasing technique that smooths edges on a per-pixel level. It is not as resource intensive as other techniques.

<a name="SpatialAliasing"></a>

#### spatial aliasing
Refers to aliasing in digital samples of visual signals.


<a name="TemporalAntiAliasing"></a>

#### temporal anti-aliasing (TAA):
An anti-aliasing technique that uses frames from a history buffer to smooth edged more effectively than fast approximate anti-aliasing. It is substantially better at smoothing edges in motion but requires motion vectors to do so.



## Lighting terms

<a name="Illuminance"></a>
#### illuminance:

A measure of the amount of light ([luminous flux](#LuminousFlux)) falling onto a given area. Differs from luminance because illuminance is a specific measurement of light whereas luminance describes visual perceptions of light.

<a name="LuminousFlux"></a>
#### luminous flux:
A measure of the total amount of visible light a light source emits.

<a name="LuminousIntensity"></a>
#### luminous intensity:
A measure of visible light as perceived by human eyes. It describes the brightness of a beam of light in a specific direction. The human eye has different sensitivities to light of different wavelengths, so luminous intensity weights each different wavelength contribution by the standard [luminosity function](#LuminosityFunction).

<a name="LuminosityFunction"></a>
#### luminosity function:
A function that describes a wave that represents the human eyeâ€™s relative sensitivity to light of different wavelengths. This wave corresponds weight values, between 0 and 1 on the vertical axis, to different wavelengths, on the horizontal axis. For example, the standard luminosity function peaks, with a weight of 1, at a wavelength of 555 nanometers and decreases symmetrically with distance from this value.


<a name="PunctualLight"></a>
#### punctual lights: 
A light is considered to be punctual if it emits light from a single point. HDRPs Spot and Point Lights are punctual.

<a name="LightIntensityUnits"></a>


### Light intensity units

<a name="Candela"></a>
#### candela:
The base unit of [luminous intensity](#LuminousIntensity) in the International System of Units. For reference, a common wax candle emits light with a luminous intensity of roughly 1 candela.

<a name="Lumen"></a>
#### lumen:
The unit of [luminous flux](#LuminousFlux). Measures the total quantity of visible light a source emits. A light source emitting 1 [candela](#Candela) of luminous intensity from an area of 1 steradian has a luminous flux of 1 lumen.

<a name="Lux"></a>
#### lux (lumen per square meter):

The unit of [illuminance](#Illuminance). A light source that emits 1 lumen of [luminous flux](#LuminousFlux) onto an area of 1 square meter has an illuminance of 1 lux.

<a name="Luminance"></a>
#### luminance (candela per square meter):

Measures the apparent brightness of light either emitted from a light source, or reflected off a surface, to the human eye. A light source that emits 1 candela of [luminous intensity](#LuminousIntensity) onto an area of 1 square meter has a luminance of 1 candela per square meter.

<a name="EV"></a>
#### exposure value (EV):

A value that represents a combination of a camera's shutter speed and f-number. It is essentially a measurement of exposure such that all combinations of shutter speed and f-number that yield the same level of exposure have the same EV. HDRP Lights can use **Ev 100**, which is EV with a 100 International Standards Organisation (ISO) film.
